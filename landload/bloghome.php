But even so, lots of people want smaller places for   <span id="dots4">.....</span><span id="more4">various reasons. And some go as far as to look for studio apartments. So what are the reasons or benefits of a studio apartment that so many people would choose it? Easy to maintain The best thing about a smaller apartment is the lack of space to mess things up. Whether you live alone or with others, things tend to just go haywire after a couple of weeks. You find you have to do a lot of cleaning up and reorganizing no matter how much you try to keep things running smoothly.

                         <p>
                             As the cost of living in Dhaka continues to soar, the thought of going abroad and settling down in a less expensive city may have come to your mind once or twice. Now leaving your homeland is undoubtedly a difficult decision, but there’s no harm in entertaining the idea a bit. But how do you determine a city’s affordability in comparison to others? Simple! You determine it by comparing a city’s Cost of Living (CoL) against a standard, which, as most organizations consider, is New York City. For example, New York’s CoL is 100, and if Dhaka’s CoL is 60, it means Dhaka is 40% less expensive than New York. So the question now is, which cities are more affordable than Dhaka? The answer to that question is right below in our list of most affordable cities in the world<span id="dots5">.....</span><span id="more5">Panam Nagar, also known as The Lost City, used to be a bustling place. Having been practically abandoned ages ago, only the untouched stones and derelict buildings remain a testament to its ancient stories. Maybe 450 years ago you would have loved the lively and busy city, but today we visit an unseemly restful place. History Common knowledge tells us that 15th century ruler Jamidar Isa Khan was the first to settle Panam Nagar as the capital of the area, though the area was popular even as far back as the 13th century. There were three large settlements; Boro Nagar, Pash Nagar and Panam Nagar. As we now can tell, Panam Nagar was and is the most renowned of the three. It was a place of great economic and political power and was the east terminus of the 2,500 km Grand Trunk Road that connected Bengal to Central Asia. </span></p>
